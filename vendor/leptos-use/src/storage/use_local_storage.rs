///
/// LocalStorage stores data in the browser with no expiration time. Access is given to all pages
/// from the same origin (e.g., all pages from "https://example.com" share the same origin).
/// While data doesn't expire the user can view, modify and delete all data stored.
/// Browsers allow 5MB of data to be stored.
///
/// This is contrast to [`fn@crate::storage::use_session_storage`] which clears data when the page session ends and is not shared.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// See [`fn@crate::storage::use_storage`] for more details on how to use.
