/// Debounce execution of a function.
///
/// > Debounce is an overloaded waiter: If you keep asking him your requests will be ignored until you stop and give him some time to think about your latest inquiry.
///
/// ## Demo
///
/// [Link to Demo](https://github.com/Synphonyte/leptos-use/tree/main/examples/use_debounce_fn)
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```
/// # use leptos::*;
/// # use leptos::ev::resize;
/// # use leptos_use::use_debounce_fn;
/// #
/// # #[component]
/// # fn Demo() -> impl IntoView {
/// let mut debounced_fn = use_debounce_fn(
///     || {
///         // do something
///     },
///     1000.0,
/// );
///
/// window_event_listener(resize, move |_| { debounced_fn(); });
/// #    view! { }
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Please note that if the current component is cleaned up before the throttled callback is called, the throttled callback will not be called.
///
/// You can also pass options to [`use_debounce_fn_with_options`] with a maximum wait time, similar to
/// [lodash debounce](https://lodash.com/docs/#debounce).
///
/// ```
/// # use leptos::*;
/// # use leptos::ev::resize;
/// # use leptos_use::use_debounce_fn_with_options;
/// # use leptos_use::utils::DebounceOptions;
/// #
/// # #[component]
/// # fn Demo() -> impl IntoView {
/// let mut debounced_fn = use_debounce_fn_with_options(
///     || {
///         // do something
///     },
///     1000.0,
///     DebounceOptions::default()
///         .max_wait(Some(5000.0)),
/// );
///
/// window_event_listener(resize, move |_| { debounced_fn(); });
/// #    view! { }
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Currently there is no way to use a function with a return value. Please open an issue if you need this.
///
/// If you want to throttle a function that takes an argument there are also the versions
/// [`use_debounce_fn_with_arg`] and [`use_debounce_fn_with_arg_and_options`].

///
/// ## Server-Side Rendering
///
/// Internally this uses `setTimeout` which is not supported on the server. So usually calling
/// a debounced function on the server will simply be ignored.
