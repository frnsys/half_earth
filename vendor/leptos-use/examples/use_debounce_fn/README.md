A simple example for `use_debounce_fn`.

If you don't have it installed already, install [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/)
as well as the nightly toolchain for Rust and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target:

```bash
cargo install trunk
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

To run the demo:

```bash
trunk serve --open
```
